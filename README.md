# CDOSekai wplaceOverlay Template
- This is an open source code I grabbed from [clrfl](<https://github.com/clrfl>) when I was browsing the r/WplaceLive/ reddit forums
- You can find the original github repo [here](<https://github.com/clrfl/wplaceOverlay>) and the reddit post [here](<https://www.reddit.com/r/WplaceLive/comments/1me5ehv/i_developed_a_canvas_overlay_for_personal_use/>)
- This is only for the use of CDOSekai Members who want to help create our logo, or if any other wplace projects come up
- You do not need to change any of the files and just need to clone the entire folder into your pc
- Do not make any commits or changes to the code, we will update this repository on our own
- If you are confused on how to install this/get it working, join our Discord Server [here](<https://discord.gg/r6mbJwsFMd>) and we can help yall out there

## Some weird bugs I noticed
- The program for some reason just refuses to work on the Brave Browser
  - So any of the following browsers work based on my experience: **Firefox**, **Chrome**,

### Enjoy!
